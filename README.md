This is a chatbot that connects to your Discord channel, reads all input, waits for "Marco" and responds "Polo".
It is minimalistic to be a good tutorial so you see how it most basically works.

# How to install
* go to discord.gg
* create an account
* create a server
* create a channel
* go to the gear icon -> advanced -> developer mode
* right-click onto your channel
* select "copy channel ID"
* you get a string like 131807197778 into the clipboard
* add this ID to the script's last line
